# MinerGame
This is game is exactly what it sounds like, a game in which you mine. Nothing currently happens yet, this is very much a WIP but is functional

## Compatibility
As far as it is known, with python 3.7.2 and pygame 1.9.6 this game runs with no issues on all operating systems

## Controls
Open the file `tutorial_setting` once you have cloned the repo and replace the 0 with a 1, controls will then appear in the top right corner of the screen. Change it to 0 again when you wish to turn it off

The only thing I will write here is that `ESC` quits the game

## Menu
There is currently no in-game menu, everything is currently controlled through different configuration files, such as `tutorial_setting` and `resourcepacks/resourcepack.txt`

## Resetting Save
To reset your savegame all you have to do is open `save-game.sav` delete its contents

## Resource Packs
Changing the look of your game is simple: open the `resourcepack.txt` in the `resourcepacks` directory. To add a resource pack create a folder with the name of your pack and add in the resource files as found in the two packs included. To have your pack added to the repo itself Direct Message me on reddit at https://reddit.com/u/Omega0x013.
