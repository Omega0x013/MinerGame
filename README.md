As far as it is known, with python 3.7.2 and pygame 1.9.6 this game runs with no issues on all operating systems

### Controls
Use WASD to move the player, Ctrl to sprint, Space to mine and Escape to quit. Set tutorial\_setting to 1 to see controls in-game.

### Menu
There is currently no in-game menu, everything is currently controlled through different configuration files, such as `tutorial_setting`.

### Resetting Save
To reset your savegame all you have to do is open `save-game.sav` delete its contents.

## Other
### Pull & Merge Requests
I may not have a chance to review pull/merge requests for a while as I am a full time student, I should recieve an email from GitHub so unless I change my notification settings I will see it relatively soon.

### Font
The font was originally created by Chequered Ink, and was then obtained using Google Fonts for free use.

### Screen Tearing
On my Ubuntu system the game experienced screen tearing during normal gameplay. This problem did not occur on a windows environment, so I can only assume that a different software was used for backend, and that one uses V-Sync while the other does not.
