# MinerGame
This is game is exactly what it sounds like, a game in which you mine. Nothing currently happens yet, this is very much a WIP but is functional

## Usage
### Compatibility
As far as it is known, with python 3.7.2 and pygame 1.9.6 this game runs with no issues on all operating systems

### Controls
Open the file `tutorial_setting` once you have cloned the repo and replace the 0 with a 1, controls will then appear in the top right corner of the screen. Change it to 0 again when you wish to turn it off

The only thing I will write here is that `ESC` quits the game

### Menu
There is currently no in-game menu, everything is currently controlled through different configuration files, such as `tutorial_setting`

### Resetting Save
To reset your savegame all you have to do is open `save-game.sav` delete its contents

## Other
### Pull & Merge Requests
I may not have a chance to review pull/merge requests for a while as I am a full time student, I should recieve an email from GitHub so unless I change my notification settings I will see it relatively soon.

### Font
The font was originally created by Chequered Ink, and was then obtained using Google Fonts for free use.

### Screen Tearing
On my Ubuntu system the game experienced screen tearing during normal gameplay. This problem did not occur on a windows environment, so I can only assume that a different software was used for backend, and that one uses V-Sync while the other does not.
